  <li>I would say that I would have to improve on several things that I have not yet mastered, such as making tables, adding links to images, making columns and rows, and adding div tags.</li>
</ul>
<li>Question 5: What problems did you encounter while you were working on this piece? How did you solve them?</li>

<ul>
  <li>I was especially satisfied with what I have completed so far, with my index.html and with what I  have learned so far.</li>
</ul>
<li>Question 7: If you were the teacher, what comments would you make about this piece?</li>
<ul>
